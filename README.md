## Background

This repository provides the code used for a secondary analysis of the [DO ART Study](https://www.thelancet.com/retrieve/pii/S2214109X20303132) on risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This analysis began as a class project for [GH 536: Advanced Methods for Global Health](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/G%20H536) at the University of Washington.
